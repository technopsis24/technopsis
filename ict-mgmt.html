       <h1>Business Process Management (BPM)</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
         <p>BPM is a general framework for managing any business processes and their interaction. It is related to ICT in two ways. First, BPM is typically implemented in software over a shared platform that integrates with the enterprise IT infrastructure and intranet services. Second, it is most important to be implemented in an ICT services provider environment since it then integrates with automated service management and quality management processes. The current universal standard for modeling business and service/product management processes is the <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/">Business Process Model and Notation, BPMN 2.02,</a> standardized by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/">Object Management Group (OMG)</a>.</p>

       <h1>Quality Management (QM)</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
       <p>Quality management ensures an organization, product, or service consistency and compliance to relevant standards. QM includes four components: quality planning, quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement. Since it is concerned with not only quality, but also the means to achieve it, QM applies to business, service management, and production processes. Total Quality Management (TQM) is a frequently used term that refers to the organization's ability to deliver high-quality products and services to customers. The main QM standards families include <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_9000">ISO 9000</a> and <a href="http://www.sixsigmacouncil.org/">Six Sigma</a>.</p>

       <h1>Innovation Management</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
         <p>Innovation management sets processes for the organization to respond to external and internal opportunities; and use its creative efforts to incubate novelty at both organization and product levels. Only in the narrow sense is innovation connected with developing new product (feature) concepts and techniques. Innovation is about developing novel concepts and methods across the organization to generate value that did not priory exist. The diffusion of innovations theory suggests that all innovations follow a similar four-phase diffusion life-cycle; known as the "S" curve: <i>emerging, growth, mature and aging</i>. Common tools include brainstorming, virtual prototyping, product life-cycle management, idea management, Phase�gate model, project management, product line planning, and portfolio management.</p>

       <h1>Knowledge Management (KM)</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
         <p>KM sets a framework to capture, develop, share, and effectively utilize organizational knowledge. Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organizational objectives such as improved performance, competitive advantage, innovation, the sharing of lessons learned, integration and continuous improvement of the organization. We view KM as a layer up information management, since knowledge is synthesized from disparate pieces information, by organizing them within a domain context. There are, however, dedicated enterprise knowledge management software platforms that derive from ECM systems. The <a href="http://www.kminstitute.org/">KM Institute</a> is the main body concerned with the development, training, and certification of KM professionals.</p>

       <h1>Information Management (IM)</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
         <p>Information management (IM) is the collection and organization of information from one or more sources and the dissemination/publishing of that information to one or more audiences, in an arbitrary format. This process involves handling information storage and access, modeling and typing, editing and styling, and possibly pre-defined 'contracted' processing. An IM system exceeds the concept of a content or document management system (CMS/DMS) to include the manipulation of information schema and transformation for purpose of modifying, or filtering, presentation and applying an arbitrary style that suits the publishing medium or format.</p>
