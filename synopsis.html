           Examples include computer systems and sub-systems architectures (e.g. multi-core processors, solid state drives, blade interconnection networks, etc.), communication protocols (e.g. HTTP, IMAP, SOAP, etc.), software frameworks and programming languages (e.g. J2EE, .NET, PHP, etc.), and so on.
         <p>The objective of "Techno'psis  Informatics" is to apply minimalist topic-based authoring 'technology', particularly DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture); in a hierarchical and extensible manner to provide a framework for domain-specific knowledge development and content management. Concept and Reference topic types can be directly used or can be specialized to support a limited-vocabulary means of describing subject technologies, services, and their management best practices. This proposition is motivated by the exponentially increasing technical and management jargon within the ICT domain; as well as the rising acceptance of DITA as a preferred single-sourcing means of documentation and information management.</p> -->

     <h1>The merit in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</h1>
      <div class="article_body"> 
        <p>ICT is the contemporary term that refers to the convergence of information and communications sciences, as reflected in the industrial disciplines of telecommunications and IT, at various levels and facets. Convergence aims at providing configurable sets of services, largely independent on terminal access devices, location, and network access method; over a seamless core network infrastructure.</p>
        <p>ICT convergence is driven by a continuum of advances in hardware, software, and telecommunications capabilities; exchanging synergies and creating 'endless' end user possibilities. Evolution towards converged service provisioning and consumption may take various paths from current state-of-the-art in each of the constituent industry disciplines.</p>
        <p>The ICT market has swiftly shaped into systems developers (aka suppliers, vendors) and service  providers, along with a median spectrum of solutions providers and systems integrators. At the other end, there are the end-user consumers of services (the beneficiaries). All parties are concerned with many aspects of a highly exponentially growing technologies, services, solutions, and management practices.</p>
        <p>Convergence is shaping at three levels: 1) infrastrcture; 2) services; and 3) access devices. Each of these levels is dependent on enabling hardware and software technologies, as well as performant systems architecture: novel hardware devices driven by material innovation; software platforms, middleware, framweworks, and languages; communications protocols; and high performance network and computing systems.</p>
        <p>Convergence is guided by continuously evolving technical standards and management best practices. It is on the hand synergized by extended end user applications at the indvidual, professional, enterprise, industrial, and governmental facets.</p>

       <h1>ICT management informatics</h1>
       <div class="article_body"> 
         <p>The conceived synopses are meant to focus on interconnecting management best practices with respect to currently convergent user-centric  access and device technologies and consequently enabled/enbling services. Topics mostly relate to description (of access methods, services and protocols, devices and applications), standards, best practices, features, and technical specifications. The objective is to foster synergies for state-of-the-art awareness and innovation, rather than delve into technical detail that are redily available within their respective contexts. It is about human-thought, automation-assited, domain specific knowledge development.</p>
         <p>Each section in this portal is itself a map of topics. A brief conceptual 'synopsis' is provided to describe the subject matter. An underlying map, rendered to WebHelp or other format, may be available for browsing. Maps of information are simply arrangeable topic groups, and may be nested within broader maps to present a specific domain profile. Individual topics may include links to related resources. Maps may include relation tables linking concept and refernce information; within their respective contexts.</p>
